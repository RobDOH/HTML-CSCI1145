# HTML-CSCI1145
 CSCI 1145 was designed to teach students the dynamics of the Web environment while pursuing an in-depth study of the most recent version of both Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Throughout the course, we worked to create a real website using HMTL and CSS on a live server environment.  Topics learnt included FTP, TCP/IP, and HTTP.
